Check your yarn tension and ensure no needles are slightly forward. Dust or old oil can also cause drag.

Try these quick fixes:

- Clean the needle bed with a soft brush
- Check that all needles are fully seated
- Apply fresh sewing machine oil to the carriage rails
- Verify your yarn tension isn't too tight
