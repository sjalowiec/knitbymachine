Yarn breaks are often caused by incorrect tension settings or a snag somewhere in the yarn path.

Check these areas:

- Verify your tension dial matches your yarn weight
- Look for burrs or rough spots on the tension mast
- Ensure the yarn isn't catching on the cone or spool
- Check that your yarn guide is properly threaded
- Try reducing carriage speed if using a motorized machine
